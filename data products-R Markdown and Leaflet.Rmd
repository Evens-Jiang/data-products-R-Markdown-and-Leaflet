Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r}
library(leaflet)

my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=31.123776, lng= 121.406949, popup="15 years' study near this place")
my_map

```
